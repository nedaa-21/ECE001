			<li><h1>Ethical Gene Editing:The notion of personalized medical care for treating diseases or disorders caused by gene mutations is achieved by understanding the patient's genetic blueprint precisely. The analysis designed to identify nucleotide order is called Genome Sequencing. With the insights from Genome sequencing, it would identify susceptible mutations to prescribe a treatment line specific to the sufferer.</h1></li>
			<li><h1>Intelligent Disaster Response system:Modern rescue systems use AI-powered drones, robots, sensors to quickly gather accurate information about the extent of the damage, the exact location of the victims trapped, topographical details of the landscape during times of crisis. Intelligent systems help emergency workers locate closest and safest assembly points when evacuating people from areas affected by the disaster. AI equipped modules for disaster management effectively stimulate mock disaster drills to identify potentially vulnerable locations, plan precautionary actions, and seamlessly monitor and govern resource allocation.</h1></li>
